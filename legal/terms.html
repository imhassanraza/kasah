          <p>Welcome to Haus!</p>
          <p><em>Using Haus binds you into a contract:</em> The below Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) are a binding contract between you and Haus Services Incorporated. These are the rules and restrictions that govern your use of Haus&#39;s websites, services, tools, and content (the &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
          <p>By using Haus, which includes visiting Haus.com, engaging with our services, tools and content, you agree to and accept these Terms. If you do not agree and accept these Terms, you may not use Haus.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@haus.com">support@haus.com</a> or by mail at 660 4th St. #418, San Francisco, CA · 94107.</p>
          <p>These Terms of Service (the &quot;Terms&quot;) are a binding contract between you and Haus Services, Inc. (&quot;Haus,&quot; &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h2 id="the-basics-of-using-haus-">The basics of using Haus:</h2>
          <p><em>Your account:</em> If you use any of the Services on the site, you may be required to provide an email address and/or create a password. We will use your email address to create an account for you.  You will not share your account information or password, if applicable, with anyone unless explicitly directed. You must protect the security of your account and your password. You are responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>
          <p><em>You understand that Haus is not a real estate broker, agent, salesperson, legal entity, accounting or financial provider.</em> Haus is a technology platform. We are not representing you in your home sale or purchase. Any real estate advice provided by a licensed real estate broker or salesperson through the Haus platform is their independent advice.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Haus will not perform any due diligence or investigation regarding title to, condition of, or use of the Properties listed on the Platform.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>You are the one doing the work, providing the information and making the decisions:</em> Haus will provide information and tools to help you sell or buy a home, but all decisions are your own.</p>
          <p><em>If you are selling a home, when you publish your listing on Haus.com, you will be entering into contract to pay Haus a platform fee of one percent (1%) of your home’s final sale price paid out of escrow at closing.</em> The platform fee is inclusive of any of the information, tools and access to independent experts provided on our site. There is no cost to engage with Haus.com prior to publishing your listing on Haus.com. Buyers do not pay any fees to use Haus.</p>
          <p><em>You must provide accurate information:</em> You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information about yourself. Some Services include tools to help create legally binding documents that depend on this accuracy. If you provide inaccurate information, including but not limited to a name other than your legal name and accurate information about your property, you jeopardize the viability of the contracts you create and create a liability for yourself in your home sale. We can’t and won’t be responsible for you providing inaccurate information while using the Services.</p>
          <p><em>You are responsible for verifying and validating the accuracy of the property information and any documents provided to you by another user through Haus.</em> We provide the platform to share the information but we don’t provide the information nor do we verify or validate it.</p>
          <p><em>You must be an adult to use Haus:</em> You represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and of legal age and capacity to form a binding contract.  If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity such as your employer or company, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, also refer to that organization or entity).</p>
          <p><em>You can only use Haus for yourself or someone who has given you the legal power to do so:</em> For example, you can’t use Haus for your parents or other relatives and sign the agreements on their behalf.  You agree to only use the Services for your own personal use or on behalf of a buyer or seller with whom you have contracted the right to represent, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any other third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law. You hereby warrant and represent to Haus that: (i) You are the owner of record of the Property or have the legal authority to enter into contract on behalf of such owner of record; (ii) there are no delinquencies or defaults under any deed of trust, mortgage or other encumbrance of the Property; (iii) the Property is not subject to the jurisdiction of any court in any bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship or probate proceeding.</p>
          <p><em>The information on the site is confidential and proprietary:</em> You understand and agree that our site and the Services involve access to confidential and proprietary information onsite including about properties, listings, offers, or counteroffers, terms, accepted prices and other listing and transactional data and onsite information, all of which is &quot;Content&quot; and is considered strictly &quot;Confidential Data&quot;.  You agree to use Confidential Data only for your own use of this site and Services in compliance with these Terms of Service and with the terms of any specific or additional Agreement you enter into with us, the Haus.  You are agreeing here not to disclose, copy, share, store, forward or republish any Confidential Data or allow any software tool or person to do so via your access.  Your obligation under the terms of this paragraph is referred to as Site Confidentiality.</p>
          <p><em>You must have the rights to the photos or other media you upload:</em> If you upload any photographs, vídeos, floor plans, or any other media you represent that you have rights to do so.</p>
          <p><em>We can use your photos and videos for Haus promotions and marketing:</em> We can use your uploaded media for Haus marketing and promotion such as showing them on social media and in ads print and digital. If you want to disallow this please send an email notice to use at support@haus.com with the subject "No Promo" and include the address of your home listing and your account email.</p>
          <p><em>You understand that Haus will share the information you input when submitted with the counter-party:</em> This includes but is not limited to the following examples: If you create a listing on Haus and indicate you want to share it, a live unique URL that can be accessed by the public will be generated. The public will be able to see the listing information and any supporting documents, like disclosure forms, that you’ve uploaded.  If you indicate you want to share the listing on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) Haus will share your listing information with the third-party real estate broker and they will share it in accordance with the Limited Service Listing Agreement you enter with them. If you are a buyer and create an offer and indicate you want to submit it to the Seller of the Property, we will share all of that information and the documents you have uploaded with the Seller, and if they have one, their agent.  Similarly if you are a Seller and counter-offer an offer submitted by a Buyer, we will share the counter-offer information with the respective Buyer, and if they have one, their agent.</p>
          <p><em>If you elect to share your listing on the MLS you agree to entering into a limited service listing agreement with the real estate broker with whom we facilitate creating your MLS listing:</em> If you create a listing on Haus and choose to share it on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) you must sign an agreement with the real estate broker who posts the listing on the MLS. We will ask you to sign it when you indicate that you want to share it on the MLS.  The Limited Service Listing Agreement can be found <a href="Limited-Service-Open-Listing-Agreement.pdf">here</a>.</p>
          <p><em>If you share your listing on the MLS you will be entering into a Real Estate Agency Relationship with a third-party Broker (“Listing Agent”) that is NOT Haus:</em> California Civil Code requires that you receive disclosure of the Seller’s agent’s obligations, even if limited. That said, the limited service broker that uploads the listing information for you on the MLS, won’t actually be doing any of those services. Haus will pay the cost of the third-party Broker as part of the Haus platform fee. By law we need to give you this disclosure on their behalf and then we also want you to understand that they won’t be doing it with the following disclosure. When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction. A Seller&#39;s agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller&#39;s agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations:</p>
          <p><u>To the Seller:</u> A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty, and loyalty in dealings with the Seller.  To the Buyer and the Seller:
          <ol type="a">
          <li>Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent&#39;s duties.</li>
          <li> A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith.</li>
          <li> A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above.</p>
          <p>Upon selecting to share your listing on the MLS you will be asked to acknowledge receipt of this Agency Disclosure and California Civil Code Sections 2079.13 to 2079.24.</p>
          <p><em>The third-party broker who uploads your listing on the MLS will not be providing any other listing agent duties:</em> If you choose to have a third-party broker (“Listing Agent”) upload your listing info on the MLS you understand that: (i) Listing Agent has been hired only to provide MLS listing service, (ii) Listing Agent will not be performing any inspection of Property, (iii) Listing Agent makes no representations or warranties regarding Property, (iv) Listing Agent will not represent Seller in this transaction, and (v) all real estate broker duties outlined in the provisions of California Civil Code Section 2079 et seq. do not apply to Listing Agent.</p>
          <h2 id="what-about-my-privacy-">Privacy:</h2>
          <p>Company takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Company Privacy Policy, please <a href="privacy.html">click here</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="sellers-who-publish-on-haus-pursuant-to-">Sellers who have Haus publish their home listing on Haus.com do so pursuant to the following:</h2>
          <p><em>Compensation to Haus</em></p>
          <p>As part of the Platform Publishing Agreement, which is executed by the Seller at the time of requesting Haus publish the listing, the Seller agrees to pay Haus a fee equal to one percent of the Property's final sale price (the "Haus Fee"). The Haus Fee will be paid out of escrow and is due only if the sale closes escrow.</p>
          <p>Seller will provide a copy of this Agreement to the escrow officer for the Property sale. Seller will instruct the escrow officer to pay the Haus Fee to Haus out of escrow at close of escrow, at the Haus address listed below. In addition, Seller authorizes Haus to provide a copy of this Agreement to the escrow officer for the Property sale, and to instruct the escrow officer to pay the Haus Fee to Haus out of escrow at close of escrow.</p>
          <p><em>Seller's obligations for disclosure</em></p>
          <p>Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all disclosures made, or required to be made, about the Property to potential buyers. Haus will under no circumstances have any responsibility to review or verify the accuracy, truthfulness or completeness of any disclosure made by or on behalf of Seller.</p>
          <p><em>The Seller acknowledges the following</em></p>
          <p>Seller must make its own determination as to the extent of real estate brokerage, legal, financial, tax or accounting advice Seller requires, and Seller must consult with its own experts and advisors.</p>
          <p>Haus will not perform any due diligence or investigation regarding title to, zoning of, use of, or condition of the Property, or any other matter affecting the Property.</p>
          <p>Buyer is solely responsible for the price and terms of any purchase offer submitted through the Haus platform. Haus will not participate in the negotiation of the terms of any such sale.  Such matters are the exclusive responsibility of Seller.</p>
          <p>Haus does not warrant the financial ability or qualifications of any potential buyer who may make an offer to purchase the Property, or the accuracy or truthfulness of any representations made by or on behalf of any potential buyers.</p>
          <p>Haus does not warrant that any offer submitted on the Platform meets Seller's qualifications.  Prior to accepting any offer, Seller will review the offer, including the proposed purchase contract and any addenda thereto, and satisfy himself/herself that the offer is satisfactory.  Seller will be solely responsible for such review.</p>
          <p>Haus does not guaranty or promise that Seller will receive any offers to purchase the Property, nor does Haus guaranty or promise any minimum price for such offers, if any.</p>

          <li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;</li>
          <li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1.1) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
          <li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li><u>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent</u> Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to remove or disable access to the infringing material; notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and terminate such content provider&#39;s access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>
          <li><p><u>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent</u> If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&#39;s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice setting forth in detail the information sufficient to persuade us that under DMCA the content provider disagrees, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider&#39;s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
          <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company&#39;s discretion.</p>
          <p>Please contact Company&#39;s Designated Agent at the following address:</p>

          <p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@haus.com">support@haus.com</a>; please refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.</p>
          <p>Haus is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Haus has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
          <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content, files or information associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your accoun. (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Company.</p>
          <p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@haus.com">support@haus.com</a> – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>
          <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
          <h2 id="terms-subject-to-change-">Terms are subject to change</h2>
          <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.haus.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>
          <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
          <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
