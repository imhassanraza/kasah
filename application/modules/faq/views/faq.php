					<h3 class='question'>How is selling with Kasah different than selling with an agent?</h3>
					<div class='answer'>Selling with Kasah means you’ll save more money (thousands to tens of thousands of dollars) on your home sale while getting access to tools and the experts you need to do it all online. If you sell with an agent, typically you have a multi-month listing agreement with them obligating you to pay them 5-6% in commission. The agent can market your home, negotiate on your behalf and they have a fiduciary responsibility to you. However, at the end of the sale you will pay out thousands of dollars to them for all their services.</div>

					<h3 class='question'>Am I creating a liability with the disclosures by not using an agent?</h3>
					<div class='answer'>As a seller, your disclosure obligations are the same whether or not the you have an agent. Having an agent does not relieve you of your duty to disclose.

When you use an agent, that agent has the same obligation to disclose as you do.</div>
				</article>

					<h3 class='question'>Am I liable if a buyer finds out something about the home after they buy it that I wasn't aware of?</h3>
					<div class='answer'>Generally, you’re not liable unless you knew or should have known of the defect. You, as the seller, need to carefully read the purchase contract before signing, so that you determine for yourself whether the contract imposes any additional duties on you. Your liability is the same whether you sell on your own or use an agent. Agents do not assume this liability for you.</div>
